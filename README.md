This Plugin brings reCAPTCHA integration to mautic 3 and 4.

## Installation via composer (preferred)

### mautic 3 & 4
Supports reCaptcha v2 and v3.

Execute `composer require aiviemarketing/mautic-recaptcha-bundle` in the main directory of the mautic installation.

Execute `composer require google/cloud-recaptcha-enterprise` in the main directory of the mautic installation.

> @todo needs to be moved to the plugins composer.json, when we support composer v2. So we can install the https://github.com/mautic/composer-plugin.

## Score validation

Recaptcha will rank traffic and interactions based on a score of 0.0 to 1.0, with a 1.0 being a good interaction and scores closer to 0.0 indicating a good likelihood that the traffic was generated by bots
